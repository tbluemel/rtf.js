# Dependencies
* rtf.js requires:
  * [jquery](https://jquery.com/)
  * [js-codepage](https://github.com/SheetJS/js-codepage/) (Apache 2.0 license)
  * symboltable.js (provided in the sample directory)
* wmf.js and emf.js require:
  * [jquery](https://jquery.com/)
  * [jquery.svg.js plugin](https://github.com/kbwood/svg) with the jquery.svgfilter.js extension.
* Rendering WMF and EMF images is accomplished by using HTML5's `<svg>` feature.
* Rendering RTF documents often requires rendering embedded WMF and EMF images, however rtf.js can be used without wmf.js and emf.js or with just one of them, if rendering such images is not required.
